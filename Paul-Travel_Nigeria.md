* Boko Haram, an extremist group based in the northeast, has targeted churches, schools, mosques, government installations, educational institutions, and entertainment venues in Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Plateau, Taraba, the Federal Capital Territory, and Yobe states.

  Islamic State West Africa, which is now a distinct group from Boko Haram, is present in Nigeria, and may seek to attack locations frequented by Westerners including major population centers.

  Kidnappings remain a security concern throughout the country and have resulted in the deaths of foreign nationals.

* Crime: Armed muggings, assaults, burglaries and home invasions, car-jackings, rape, and extortions occur regularly and often involve violence. Law enforcement authorities usually respond slowly or not at all and provide little or no investigative support to victims.

* There s a high threat of kidnap throughout Nigeria. Recent terrorist kidnaps have occurred mostly in northern Nigeria, but could occur anywhere. There are reports that Boko Haram is actively planning to kidnap foreigners, including in Bama Local Government Area of Borno state, along the Kumshe-Banki axis.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Nigeria. Most attacks occur in the north east, particularly in Borno (including central Maiduguri and along access routes connecting the city to other major towns), Yobe, Adamawa and Gombe States. There have also been significant attacks in Kano, Kaduna, Jos and Bauchi States and in the capital Abuja.

* The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to:
  * Borno State
  * Yobe State
  * Adamawa State
  * Gombe State
  * Riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross River States
  * Within 20km of the border with Niger in Zamfara State

* The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:
  * Bauchi State
  * Zamfara State
  * Kano State
  * Kaduna State
  * Jigawa State
  * Katsina State
  * Kogi State

* Extreme Risk

  There is extreme risk to your security in the north-eastern states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, and Yobe and we advise against all travel. There is an ongoing significant threat from terrorism and a very high threat of kidnapping in these areas. Any New Zealanders currently in these areas are advised to leave immediately.  
  There is extreme risk to your security in the delta states of Abia, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bayelsa, Delta, and Rivers (including Port Harcourt and Bonny Island) and the riverine areas of Cross River state in the south east of the country and we advise against all travel. The significant risk of kidnapping, armed attacks against foreign oil companies and expatriate workers, localised conflict and violent civil unrest present an extreme risk to safety in these areas.

* High Risk

  There is high risk to your security elsewhere in Nigeria (except the city of Lagos), due to the threat from terrorism, kidnapping and violent crime. We advise against all tourist and other non-essential travel.

* Some Risk

  There is some risk to your security in the city of Lagos due to the threat of terrorism and violent crime and we advise caution.

* I've just come back from Lagos, and like you, am not the stay-at-home kind. But my host absolutely refused to let me out of the city, even with him, even just back to his birthplace of Abeokuta. And he is very sensible. So I'd say no. Why run the risk? [...] Just out of concern for a fellow human being- if you truly feel that you have been in places in the states where 'common sense is absolutely essential for survival', and you're seriously comparing that to anywhere in west Africa, let alone rural Nigeria on a bus, then honestly? I don't think you're even close to being prepared. Ask your Nigerian friends and do what they say. Seems to me no friend would even hear of it. I know full well that no Nigerian I know would take a bus to Benin or visit Kanu just for fun. When in Rome, you know.

* Lagos and Abuja is peaceful in fact those are my residential states, feel free to visit Nigeria but pls make sure u have a good friend that wil help u in anything u want to do, mind ur own business, and do seek for help in any Catholic/Anglican/Methodist or Baptist church to name a few whenever u are stranded, take care dear and enjoy ur stay.

* **LAGOS** As well as brilliantly buoyant culture, Lagos has bumper-to-bumper cars, noise and pollution beyond belief, a high crime rate, and maxed-out public utilities. Elevated motorways ringing the island city are jammed with speed freaks and absurd traffic jams ('go-slows') on top, and tin-and-cardboard shacks underneath. It's a divided city, but an undeniably exciting one.

* Driving
  Driving in Nigeria (especially Lagos) is somewhat unique, vaguely resembling driving in Cairo. If mastered, you should however be able to cope in most other countries on the planet. Or any other planet. Roads are bad. Expect potholes of every size. Expect people to drive on the wrong side to avoid potholes or just bad patches of road. Even on the highway. Expect the road to be gone. Expect everything. Grass or branches on the road means there is a broken down vehicule ahead of you, be careful.

  If you are white, get used to Nigerians shouting at you as you pass by. It will be something like "Oyinbo", "MBakara", "Bature" or "white man" if you're white. It all means the same, they are just telling you.

  Self-driving for short-term visitors unfamiliar with the roads, especially in Lagos, is by no means advisable and could actually be quite foolish if not dangerous. With crime on the rise, you could easily wander into an area or a road bl* ock set by local gangs. If you choose to rent a car, it will come with a driver familiar with the area and style of driving, which is a much easier and safer option.

* Safety
  Nigeria is a fairly dangerous destination. It is highly advisable to travel with a Nigerian friend or visit a Nigerian friend, it could be your only way to enjoy the country to its fullest without you having to sleep with an eye open.
  You can go to Abuja, the Capital. Although it is in the Central part of Nigeria, it houses most dignitaries and politicians, so it has a high level of security.
  Crime levels are high, particularly in Lagos.
  Be wary of travelling by road outside of the cities at night due to the risk of armed robbery
  The Niger delta area is unsafe for tourists. There is continual low-level violence between government and militant groups, and there have been several kidnappings of foreign oil workers.
  Northern Nigeria is unsafe for foreigners (especially westerners) due to ethnic and religious tensions, lawlessness and the current activities of Islamist groups such as Boko Haram.
  Eastern and Western Nigeria are the safer for foreigners, but there is a high rate of arm robbery activities.
  The waters outside Nigeria is one of the most likely places to be attacked by modern day pirates.

  * **Security risks due to Nigerian terrorists are incredibly high and should be on the mind of anyone travelling to the country**

  Terrorist threats   and Boko Haram in particular   have unfortunately put Nigeria into world news more than anything else, period. The Islamic extremist group, which pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2015, is responsible for the deaths of over 20,000 people and the displacement of over two million.

  The group is especially dangerous in the northern parts of the country, where the Nigerian police and military have struggled to keep the threat contained. But Boko Haram has staged attacks as far south as Abuja, too. [ ] Ansaru, a splinter group, has kidnapped foreigners in Kebbi, Katsina and Bauchi States.

  Foreigners are advised not to get anywhere near the northeastern states where Boko Haram is most active and to exercise extreme caution in much of the North and large parts of the South.

* Street Crime
  Street crime, whether organized by gangs or random, is a major concern in much of Nigeria. There are active gangs in many regions, including the Area Boys in Lagos State and the Bakassi Boys in the Igbo region.
  Most foreign travel advisories from Western governments mention the prevalence of street crime due to poverty in many cities and rural areas with muggings, rapes, kidnappings, car-jackings and armed robberies being the main threats. Unfortunately, there are no  safe  states as such, and all regions appear to be affected.

* Personal Security
  Nigerians are wonderful people and the country has a tremendous number of good things going for it. But there s no doubt that it s a tough place to visit, and there s a reason expats typically negotiate significant hardship allowances when stationed there. The Ibrahim Index ranks personal safety in Nigeria pretty close to the bottom: 48th out of the 54 African countries surveyed.

* Travel in the Country
  Drive, don t walk: In general we recommend that foreign visitors be driven wherever they need to go and avoid walking altogether both during the day or after dark.
  Don t drive yourself: If you are involved in an accident, whether it s your fault or not and even a fender-bender, you open yourself to all kinds of trouble. Be sure your driver is properly trained and insured.
  Don t drive at night: We generally recommend that our clients stay off all but the safest roads in central business districts after nightfall. Expect bad road conditions, very poor lighting and the risk of car-jackings in some regions. Robberies and kidnappings occur even on expressways in several states, so be vigilant.

(Discussion of safety by random Nigerians!)
* Traveling to Nigeria is relatively safe depending on which region of the country you are traveling to and the places you plan on visiting. Traveling to cosmopolitan cities like Lagos, Abuja, etc is safe because of the fact that there are security officials in such places. However traveling to certain part of the country might not be that safe. [ ] In fact cities on Red Alert are not safe for travel, you can easily check this out from the internet.

* It's very safe to travel to Nigeria. It's not all doom and gloom as it's been portrayed across different  social media platforms. However, there's the need to ask, what part of the country are you travelling to? There are some flash points within the Country that may warrant you taking necessary precautions .
