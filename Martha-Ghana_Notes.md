* Ghana – Togo: official border crossing point at Aflao
* Togo—Benin: border crossing point at Hilacondji

[**Note**: some travel bloggers—via private car and public transportation—suggest to avoid Badagry border crossing point, if possible, as this crossing point tends to be complicated (long waiting time, bribery,…) Bloggers suggest using a smaller border, such as the border “north from Kétou to Meko.”
